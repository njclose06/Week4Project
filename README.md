# Week4Project

This is the Week 4 Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

Using files downloaded from a specified URL, the instructions were to create an R script that:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The Codebook.md file explains about the data used and shows an annotated R script which does all 5 steps above.

The run_analysis.R script is the script that will do each of the steps.

The tidydata file is the output file for the assignment.
